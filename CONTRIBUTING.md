## Development Workflow for External Contributors

As an external contributor, you'll need to follow the fork-based workflow. This ensures a safe and organized way to contribute to the project.

### 1. Fork the Repository
1. Visit https://github.com/Mindverse/Second-Me
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination

### 2. Clone Your Fork
After forking, clone your fork to your local machine:
```bash
cd working_dir
# Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
```

### 3. Configure Upstream Remote
To keep your fork up to date with the main repository:
```bash
# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git

# Verify your remotes
git remote -v
# You should see:
# origin    git@github.com:USERNAME/Second-Me.git (fetch)
# origin    git@github.com:USERNAME/Second-Me.git (push)
# upstream  git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git (fetch)
# upstream  git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git (push)
```

### 4. Keep Your Fork Updated
Before creating a new feature branch, ensure your fork's main branch is up to date:
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your main branch on top of upstream main
git rebase upstream/main

# Optional: Update your fork on GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 5. Create a Feature Branch
Always create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Make Your Changes
Make your desired changes in the feature branch. Make sure to:
- Follow the project's coding style
- Add tests if applicable
- Update documentation as needed

### 7. Commit Your Changes
```bash
# Add your changes
git add <filename>
# Or git add -A for all changes

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
```

### 8. Update Your Feature Branch
Before submitting your PR, update your feature branch with the latest changes:
```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 9. Push to Your Fork
```bash
# Push your feature branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
